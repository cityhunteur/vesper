# Vesper Security Review Map

Vesper’s security model is part of its parity contract. Treat this file as the entry point for security-sensitive work.

## Trust boundaries

1. Host macOS control plane
   - `vesperd`
   - host-visible Unix sockets
   - entitlement-bearing binaries
2. Linux System VM
   - containerd and internal runtime surfaces
   - optional stock Firecracker and jailer for Backend A
3. Guest microVM workloads
   - isolated workloads behind the control plane

## Host exposure rules

- `vesperd` is the public control-plane endpoint.
- `vesper-proxy` may expose a host-visible socket only for the intended Docker or container runtime UX.
- Raw Firecracker and raw containerd sockets stay private to the System VM.

## Security-sensitive changes

Treat these as security-sensitive:
- entitlement changes,
- socket exposure changes,
- filesystem boundary changes,
- sandbox or process-lifecycle changes,
- proxy target parsing,
- any change that widens host ↔ System VM reachability.

## Required checks

At minimum, use:
```bash
make validate-entitlements
cargo test
python3 scripts/harness/check_structure.py --root .
python3 scripts/harness/janitor_scan.py --root .
```

Plus runtime evidence when the change affects real transport or VM lifecycle.

## Review rules

- Do not broaden entitlements without a concrete requirement and proof.
- Do not expose a new host-visible socket unless the design doc or execution plan says why.
- Do not accept undocumented compat drift as a silent temporary state.
- Keep boundary parsing explicit and deterministic.
